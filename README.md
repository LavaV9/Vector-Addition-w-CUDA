# Vector Addition w CUDA
Simple Project For Learning CUDA Basics (and getting back into C++)
just adding a commit so it shows up on github

Nothing too impressive, just the building blocks and setup for a larger project I will working on.

Adds two vectors using CUDA Kernels and help me learn the basics of cpu gpu threads etc again

Got a way to run it on colab with their T4 run time since I currently dont have access to a hpc
